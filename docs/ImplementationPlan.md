# Implementation Plan for Enhanced QA Generation with Graph-Based Processing

This document outlines the implementation plan for enhancing our QA pair generation using graph-based document processing while maintaining compatibility with the current output format. We'll use Qdrant as our vector store for improved semantic processing.

## Phase 1: Core Infrastructure

### 1.1 Base Data Structures
- [x] Implement `DocumentNode` structure with:
  - Basic metadata (id, type, content)
  - Vector embedding support
- [x] Implement `DocumentEdge` with relationship types
- [x] Create `DocumentGraph` structure

### 1.2 Vector Store Integration
- [x] Set up Qdrant client with persistence
- [x] Implement embedding generation pipeline
- [x] Create efficient vector storage and retrieval system
- [x] Add batch processing support

### 1.3 Graph Construction
- [ ] Implement document parsing pipeline
  - Markdown support
  - Code block handling
  - Section/subsection detection
- [x] Build node creation logic
- [x] Implement edge creation and relationship detection
- [x] Add vector embedding generation for nodes

## Phase 2: Enhanced Analysis

### 2.1 Context Analysis
- [x] Implement path-to-root analysis
- [x] Build related nodes detection
- [x] Create relationship type analyzer
- [x] Add semantic similarity computation using vector store

### 2.2 Graph Traversal
- [x] Implement basic graph traversal algorithms
- [x] Add context window management

### 3.2 Answer Generation
- [x] Implement answer context collection
- [x] Create answer validation using graph context
- [x] Add semantic verification using vector store
- [x] Ensure output compatibility with current format:
  ```json
  {
    "question": "string",
    "answer": "string"
  }
  ```

## Phase 4: Pipeline Integration

### 4.1 Processing Pipeline
- [x] Create pipeline configuration system
- [x] Implement processing stages
- [x] Add progress tracking
- [x] Build pipeline optimization
- [x] Ensure persistence of vector store collections

### 4.2 Output Management
- [x] Implement JSONL output formatter
